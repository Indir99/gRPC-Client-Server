# gRPC Client and Server in C++

This repository contains a sample implementation of a gRPC client and server in C++. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework originally developed by Google. It provides efficient communication between distributed systems and is widely used for building scalable APIs and microservices.

## Features

- **Client-Server Communication**: Demonstrates bidirectional communication between a gRPC client and server.
- **Protocol Buffers (protobuf)**: Utilizes protocol buffers for defining the service interface and message types.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Utilizes asynchronous programming techniques for handling RPC calls.
- **Error Handling**: Implements error handling mechanisms for robustness.
- **C++ Implementation**: Written in modern C++ for performance and maintainability.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- C++ compiler with C++11 support
- CMake (version 3.0 or higher)
- gRPC and Protocol Buffers compiler (protoc)
